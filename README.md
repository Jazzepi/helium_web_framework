# helium web framework
Helium is a WIP web framework intending to make web development more simplified rather than complicated.

Many of the most commonly used frameworks such as React and Angular have alot of differant parts to them for
various differant things such as routing, components, component methods/hooks, lifecycles, ect.

Helium on the other hand simplifies things.


# Components:
Components are only written as classes, no function style components. Components can be statefull or stateless.
Components are similar to react class components in terms of using them. JSX is on the todo list and will soon
be implemented for rendering components.

# HTTP requests and APIs
Helium has a HTTPController class used for creating controllers for differant APIs

# State Management
Helium implements it's own state management inspired by Redux Toolkit

# Routing
Helium has a router class on the todo list to handle clientside routing

# Internationalization
Helium intends to support internationalization without the need to complicate things

# Bundling
Helium has webpack on the todo list to be implemented along side babel

# DOM and Virtual DOM
Helium implements its own virtual dom, currently in a simple form that will evolve further later as needed

# Typescript
Helium does not utilize typescript, there is little need to support it at this time and little desire to do so.
Javascript is typeless, and helium aims to not implement things unless they are needed. This way development remains simple


# TODO LIST:
1. Implement JSX
2. Implement Webpack and Babel
3. Implement Internationalization
4. Implement Clientside Routing
5. Refine State Management
6. Refine HTTPController class
7. Refine Component class
8. Implement testing via Jest
